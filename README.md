## ❓ FAQ

**Q: Why only 5-6 words per page?**
A: Research shows this is the optimal number for retention without disrupting reading flow.

**Q: Can I use Fluent on work computers?**
A: Yes! Fluent stores all data locally and doesn't require any special permissions.

**Q: How accurate are the translations?**
A: We use Microsoft Translator, which provides professional-quality translations.

**Q: Will this slow down my browsing?**
A: No. Fluent processes pages in <50ms and has strict performance limits.

**Q: Can I trust Fluent with my API key?**
A: Yes. Your API key is encrypted and stored only in Chrome's secure storage. It's never sent anywhere except Microsoft's API.

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Extension Not Working
1. Check if the site is blacklisted (banking, government sites)
2. Ensure you haven't hit the daily limit (50 words)
3. Try refreshing the page
4. Check Chrome console for errors (F12)

### Translations Not Appearing
1. Verify the page has enough text content
2. Check if site is paused in Page Control widget
3. Ensure correct language is selected

### API Key Issues
1. Verify key is correctly copied (no spaces)
2. Check Azure portal for key validity
3. Ensure Translator resource is not suspended
